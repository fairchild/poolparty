== chef-deploy

A gem that provides resources and providers for deploying ruby web apps from chef recipes


Uses the same directory layout as capistrano and steals the git remote cached deploy strategy 
from cap and adapts it to work without cap and under chef

 deploy "/data/#{app}" do
   repo "git://github.com/engineyard/rack-app.git"
   branch "HEAD"
   user "ez"
   enable_submodules true
   migrate true
   migration_command "rake db:migrate"
   environment "production"
   shallow_clone true
   revision '0xbeadbeef'
   action :deploy # or :rollback
 end


Currently only supports doing the cached git checkout, rsyncing it into place and doing the symlink dance.
Does not restart servers or have hooks(yet)
